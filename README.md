# HSL Color Palette Generator

With this tool you can create a color palette from any given base color. The
palette is generated using HSL colors. I explain this in detail in an article 
on my blog. I mainly use this method to create palettes for game development.

## Development

Install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

You can than start the compilation process (& preview) by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app can then be viewed under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
